You are to write Tkinter code on repl.it for the GUI shown in the tkinterStudyProblem.png file to the right, using the accounts.py code from How To 10.1 -

This can be done in stages:

1. Radiobuttons for the checking and savings accounts to display the current balance when the account is selected.

NOTE: You will need to create a Checking and SavingsAccount instance in your code.  

2. Extend the GUI to include an amount field that is added to the currently selected account when the deposit button is clicked, updating the display of the account's balance.

3. If time permits, extend to include a try-except on the amount field to handle a ValueError.

Download the completed main.py and submit on Canvas once submitted on Repl.it
